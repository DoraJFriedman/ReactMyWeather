My react weather app. Includes: fahrenheit/celsius toggling, climate factors of windspeed, atmospheric pressure, visibility, cloudiness, precipitation probability, dew point, UVI, and moon phase number. I used the dependencies react-animated-weather, bootstrap, prop-types, axios, react-dom, and react-scripts to create this app with a current, three hour, and six day forecast.
